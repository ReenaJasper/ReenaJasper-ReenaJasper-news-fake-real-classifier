 News Article Classification â€“ Fake vs Real

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real**.
Objective: To build a classification model that detects fake news based on article content using traditional ML techniques and deploy it via Streamlit.

Tools & Technologies used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Streamlit
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression

Model Overview
- Vectorizer: TF-IDF with top 5000 features
- Classifier: Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: ~99% on test data

ðŸ“ˆ How It Works
1. User enters news content.
2. Text is cleaned & transformed using TF-IDF.
3. Model predicts: ðŸŸ¢ Real or ðŸ”´ Fake.
4. Result is displayed in a clean interface.

âœ… Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook (Colab)
- Trained model + vectorizer
- Streamlit Web App
- 2-page Report (see below)
